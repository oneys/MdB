The previous AI engineer focused on stabilizing and enhancing a SaaS real estate platform. Initial work involved resolving critical frontend white screen errors and persistence bugs in drag & drop functionality. A major UI/UX overhaul to a Base SaaS Dashboard UI Kit style was completed, integrating modern components. Core features like project CRUD operations (create, edit, delete with double confirmation), Google Maps integration, and a cost distribution pie chart were implemented. Most recently, the engineer confirmed the application's operational status, read , verified service health, and successfully executed a comprehensive backend test suite using , reporting 100% test pass rate for 16 tests. The immediate next step proposed was to validate frontend features, offering the user a choice between automated or manual testing.

The platform aims to assist real estate dealers (marchands de biens) with Go/No Go decisions, project tracking, automated financial calculations (TVA sur marge, acquisition costs, net margin, IRR), and official document generation. Key features include a dashboard with KPIs, a Kanban pipeline, a fiscal estimator with tax regimes and notary fees, project sheets, a dataroom, and PDF export. Authentication supports Email/OAuth2 with role management. The UI/UX was specified to be modern, evolving to a Base SaaS Dashboard UI Kit. User requests emphasized fixing a white screen error, resolving drag & drop persistence, ensuring dynamic calculations, addressing document handling, enabling project status editing from detail pages, integrating Google Maps for project creation/modification, and a cost distribution pie chart.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Core FastAPI backend. Implemented , updated project update logic for , expanded  enum, and corrected MongoDB update syntax.
-   ****: Main React component. Fixed   context, integrated backend API calls, removed mock data, updated  colors, and replaced old UI with , passing  data.
-   ****: Centralized authentication context. Newly created and integrated to resolve circular dependencies.
-   ****: Directory for new modern UI components.
    -   ****: Container for modern UI. Integrates and manages state for dashboard, pipeline, estimator, project details, forms, and sidebar.
    -   ****: Modern dashboard. Corrected project address display and added logic for dynamic charts.
    -   ****: Modern fiscal estimator. Corrected display of notary fees and net margin.
    -   ****: Modern Kanban. Added edit/delete with double confirmation and fixed footer for statistics.
    -   ****: Modern project detail page. Added edit/delete, corrected address display, integrated cost distribution pie chart.
    -   ****: New component for editing projects. Integrated Google Maps.
    -   ****: Multi-step project creation form. Ensured correct API calls, implemented image upload, and integrated Google Maps.

<pending_tasks>
-   Validate Google Maps integration in project creation and modification forms.
-   Confirm full functionality and persistence of project creation.
-   Visually validate the cost distribution pie chart on project pages.
-   Implement and integrate advanced Dataroom features.
-   Develop and integrate advanced Analytics graphs.
-   Integrate a Calendar for task and appointment planning.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed a comprehensive backend testing phase. The application's UI has been fully migrated to a Base SaaS Dashboard UI Kit style, with all legacy components removed. Recent functional additions, still requiring frontend validation, include Google Maps integration in  and  for project creation and modification, and a cost distribution pie chart in . The  was also refined for correct API calls and validation. The engineer read the  file, confirmed all services (backend, frontend, MongoDB) were running, identified the correct frontend URL, and updated  with new validation tasks. The backend was thoroughly tested using , passing all 16 tests, confirming its stability and readiness. The system currently hosts 8 demo projects, supports full CRUD, a functional Kanban, and a fiscal estimator.
