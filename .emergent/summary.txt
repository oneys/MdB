The AI engineer successfully built an MVP for a real estate property dealer platform. Initially, the focus was on core features: Dashboard, Kanban Pipeline, and Fiscal Estimator. A significant challenge was the implementation and debugging of the OAuth authentication flow using Emergent Integrations, which required multiple iterations to fix session persistence, cookie configuration, and correct React Router navigation. The AI engineer demonstrated a systematic debugging approach by inspecting backend logs, frontend code, and using a debug button for OAuth testing. Currently, the platform has basic project management, authentication, and core calculation features. The latest task involves enabling project creation and management, which has just received a code edit.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop a SaaS platform for real estate property dealers (marchands de biens) to enable Go/No Go decisions in under 15 minutes, centralize project tracking, automate key calculations (TVA sur marge, acquisition costs, net margin, IRR), generate bank/notary files, manage KYC/AML compliance (TRACFIN), and provide a visual dashboard with KPIs.
MVP priorities include Dashboard, Kanban Pipeline, Fiscal Estimator (with detailed TVA regimes, notary fees, and 0.715% rights for MdB), Project Sheet, Dataroom, PDF Export (Bank/Notary), Email/OAuth2 authentication (Google/Microsoft) with roles, and light KYC/TRACFIN compliance. AI integration for document analysis and Go/No Go assistance is also planned for future versions. The platform requires a modern, clean UI/UX using Shadcn/UI with specific color palettes and accessibility considerations.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor for async), Pydantic (data validation), PyJWT (authentication), Passlib (password hashing), Emergent Integrations (for LLM/OAuth).
-   **Frontend:** React (SPA), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI (components), React Router (navigation), Axios (HTTP requests), Zustand (state management).
-   **Database:** MongoDB for project data, estimates, costs. Configuration for transactions and indexes.
-   **Authentication:** JWT with refresh tokens, OAuth2 (Google/Microsoft) via Emergent Integrations.
-   **Calculations:** Python-based logic for real estate tax (TVA, DMTO, notary fees, net margin, TRI).
-   **Deployment:** Kubernetes, Supervisor (service control).
-   **Utilities:** ReportLab/WeasyPrint (PDF generation), Pillow (image processing).

-   ****: This file is the core of the backend. It defines FastAPI routes for various modules: authentication (login, logout, OAuth callbacks), project management (CRUD for projects), fiscal estimation, Dataroom (file uploads/downloads), and KYC/TRACFIN. It was heavily modified to include new endpoints, refine the authentication logic (session handling, roles), integrate Emergent authentication, and support PDF generation by adding  and  imports.
-   ****: This is the main React application component. It handles global state, routing, and integrates various UI components. It was extensively modified to implement the Dashboard, Kanban Pipeline, Estimator, Project Sheet, Dataroom, and Authentication UI. Significant changes included setting up React Router, implementing  and  contexts for authentication, adding , , , , and , and fixing navigation issues ( to ). It also incorporates Shadcn UI components for a modern look.
-   ****: This file lists Python dependencies. It was updated to include , , , , and  for JWT handling.
-   ****: This file lists Node.js dependencies. It was updated with packages for React Router () and various Shadcn/UI-related libraries.
-   ** & **: These files manage environment variables. They contain  (frontend) and  (backend), crucial for service communication and database access.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fiche Projet**: Implement detailed panels (Budget, Tasks, Dataroom, Event Journal).
-   **Dataroom & Export**: Implement multi-file upload, generation of PDF dossiers (Bank/Notary).
-   **Analytics**: Implement cumulative margin, cash-flow, capital distribution, and price/work sensitivity graphs.
-   **AI Integrations**: Implement OCR for document analysis and AI-assisted Go/No Go decision support.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the user reported that they could not create or manage projects, and that the estimator tab was empty with no simulation tool. The AI engineer debugged the issue, identifying that the ProjectForm and Estimator components were commented out or not properly integrated into .

The AI engineer corrected this by first identifying the problem in  where  and  components were placeholders or commented out. Then, edits were made to  to re-implement these components, making them functional. Additionally, the AI engineer addressed a persistent authentication issue, adjusting backend cookie configurations (, ) and modifying frontend authentication flow to ensure session persistence and proper routing after login.

The last action recorded was a successful edit (Chat Message 198) which is presumed to be related to the user's request for project creation/management, likely involving the  component and its integration into the UI. The specific content of this last edit is not fully detailed in the observation, but it is in direct response to the user's need to créer/gérer de projets.

<optional_next_step>
Verify if project creation and management functionalities are now working correctly on the platform.
