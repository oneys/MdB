The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a SaaS platform for real estate dealers, focusing on MVP features across four phases. Initially, authentication with Emergent Integrations, a Dashboard, Kanban Pipeline, and Fiscal Estimator were developed. A recurring challenge was the OAuth flow and session persistence, which required multiple debugging iterations, including the creation of a temporary development login. The AI engineer also implemented JSON-based barèmes for fiscal calculations.

Following this, Phase 2 added detailed project panels (Budget, Tasks, Event Journal) and an interactive Kanban Pipeline. Phase 3 extended functionality to project modification, a Dataroom for multi-file upload/download, and Analytics. However, the user consistently reported critical persistence issues (projects not saving, modifications not persisting, drag & drop broken) and functionality gaps (document upload/download, dynamic journal/tasks, non-dynamic TRI). The AI engineer attempted multiple fixes, leading to cycles of bug reports.

A significant point was the AI's detailed explanation of technical limitations (cloud infrastructure, external APIs) versus what it could fix. The AI then implemented several fixable items: robust Pydantic validation, error handling, advanced calculations, rate limiting, MongoDB indices, and optimized frontend state. Despite these efforts, the user's last report is a white screen error, indicating a critical frontend failure, suggesting ongoing instability and unresolved issues despite repeated fixes and claims of completion.

The overarching goal is to create a SaaS platform for real estate property dealers (marchands de biens) to facilitate quick Go/No Go decisions, centralize project tracking, automate key financial calculations (TVA sur marge, acquisition costs, net margin, IRR), generate official documents (bank/notary files), and manage KYC/AML compliance. The platform requires a visual dashboard with KPIs, a Kanban pipeline, a fiscal estimator with detailed tax regimes and notary fees, project sheets, a dataroom, and PDF export capabilities. Authentication must be via Email/OAuth2 (Google/Microsoft) with role management. A modern UI/UX using Shadcn/UI is specified. Future plans include AI integration for document analysis and Go/No Go assistance, which was later modified by the user to focus on project modification instead. The user emphasized a lean, phased approach, with strict acceptance criteria for each phase, prioritizing stabilization and core functionality over new features.

-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor), Pydantic, PyJWT, Passlib, Emergent Integrations, ReportLab, Pillow, SlowAPI (rate limiting).
-   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, React Router, Axios, Zustand.
-   **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth2 (Google/Microsoft), session management.
-   **Calculations**: Python logic for TVA, DMTO, notary fees, TRI, net margin.
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: The core FastAPI backend application. It defines API endpoints for authentication (login, logout, OAuth, dev session), project CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete, status change), fiscal estimation, Dataroom (file upload/download/delete), and PDF generation (Bank/Notary dossiers). This file has been extensively modified to integrate new routes, refine authentication logic, load JSON barèmes, add Pydantic validation, error handling, rate limiting, and MongoDB indexing.
-   ****: The main React application component, handling global state and routing. It has been heavily modified to set up React Router for various pages (Dashboard, Pipeline, Estimator, ProjectDetail, ProjectForm, DataroomPanel, AnalyticsPanel, LoginPage, ErrorPage), and new marketing pages (HomePage, PricingPage, ContactPage). It integrates  and  and was crucial for fixing navigation and session issues.
-   ****: Created to store dynamic DMTO (Droits de Mutation à Titre Onéreux) rates for fiscal calculations, replacing hardcoded values.
-   ****: Created to store dynamic notary fee structures and other related costs, replacing hardcoded values.
-   ****: Created/modified to implement global error handling and potentially other middleware logic for the FastAPI application.
-   ** (HomePage, PricingPage, ContactPage)**: New React components created to serve as marketing pages for the SaaS platform, separate from the core application logic.
-   ** (and related components)**: This component and its sub-components (like , , , ) are central to displaying project details, handling modifications, managing documents, visualizing analytics, and enabling interactive tasks. It has seen numerous modifications for drag & drop logic, form submissions, and data display.

-   Ensure document upload appears correctly and downloads function reliably.
-   Implement dynamic TRI and other calculations consistently across the application.
-   Make the event journal truly dynamic and reflective of all project changes.
-   Integrate full interactive task management with backend persistence.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed Phase 4, implementing features like full document storage (upload, download, delete) on the backend, automated PDF export for bank/notary dossiers, and advanced task management APIs. The frontend Dataroom and PDF export buttons were also integrated. The AI then conducted extensive backend tests, which it reported as successful, and attempted frontend tests, where it noted SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG but still provided an overall positive summary claiming the architecture was ready for production.

Following this, the user provided critical feedback, reporting that uploaded documents did not appear, downloads failed, TRI was not dynamic, and the drag & drop in the pipeline was again buggy. The user explicitly requested all numbers and info to be dynamic, and for the AI to perform all necessary tests and corrections before reporting back.

The AI engineer initiated a series of critical fixes addressing document synchronization, drag & drop logic, dynamic TRI/calculations, downloads, and missing authentication functions. It also updated Pydantic validations, error handling, calculations, rate limiting, and MongoDB indices. After these fixes, the AI reported successful backend tests. However, during subsequent frontend testing, a SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG occurred, and finally, the user reported a white screen error. The AI is currently diagnosing this white screen issue, having checked supervisor logs and confirming the frontend compiles, and is now investigating potential JavaScript errors.

<optional_next_step>
Continue diagnosing and resolving the white screen error reported by the user on the frontend.
