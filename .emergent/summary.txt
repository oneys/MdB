The AI engineer successfully enhanced a SaaS real estate platform, focusing on UI/UX, feature additions, and critical bug fixes. Initial work involved migrating to a Base SaaS Dashboard UI Kit, implementing project CRUD, Google Maps, and cost distribution charts. Subsequent tasks included creating a primary grid view for projects with sorting and filtering, and enabling a toggle to the Kanban view. Key challenges involved fixing backend validation for French accented characters, ensuring Google Maps integration and display from various link formats, correcting frontend form data structures for project editing (address and department), and resolving persistent issues with the project detail page's status change dropdown, which was eventually resolved by re-structuring the component to remove a blocking backdrop. The last validated task ensured the status dropdown was fully functional, and buttons on the project detail page were styled correctly.

The platform supports real estate dealers by aiding Go/No Go decisions, project tracking, automated financial calculations (TVA sur marge, acquisition costs, net margin, IRR), and document generation. Core features include a dashboard, Kanban pipeline, fiscal estimator, project sheets, dataroom, and PDF export, with Email/OAuth2 authentication. Initial requests focused on resolving white screen errors, drag & drop persistence, dynamic calculations, document handling, project status editing, Google Maps integration (creation/modification), and a cost distribution pie chart. Later, the user explicitly requested a primary grid/card view for projects with sorting by status (abandoned last), filters, and a search bar, toggling to Kanban. Further requests included a Google Maps link field in the project creation form, 4 projects per row with a main photo banner in the grid view, an editable status dropdown on the project detail page, correct display of the department field, reordering sections on the project detail page, and styling Edit/Delete buttons on the project page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a persistent bug with the status change dropdown on the `ModernProjectDetail.js` page. The issue was identified as a conflicting backdrop blocking clicks on dropdown options. The solution involved re-structuring the dropdown component to remove the problematic backdrop, ensuring full functionality for status changes. This was visually validated via screenshots and console logs, confirming that statuses could be successfully updated (e.g., from "Détecté" to "Travaux").

Before this, significant work was completed:
*   **Project Views**: A primary grid view (`ModernProjectsGrid.js`) was implemented, displaying 4 projects per row with a photo banner, compact financial metrics, sorting by status (abandoned last), and a search bar. A toggle allows switching to the secondary Kanban view (`ModernPipeline.js`), which now has a fixed and always visible footer with key statistics.
*   **Project Creation/Modification**: The backend (`server.py`) was updated to allow French accented characters in project labels and to include a `google_maps_link` field. The `ModernProjectForm.js` now includes a "Lien Google Maps" input and a "Niveau davancement (status) dropdown. The  component was fixed to correctly handle address objects (including department) and the department field was added to its UI.
*   **Project Detail Page**: Google Maps is now integrated into , displaying a map from the  or constructed from the project address. Sections on the detail page were reordered, placing Répartition des coûts before Localisation. The Modifier and Supprimer buttons were moved next to Ajouter photos and styled with outline borders.
All these recent changes have been verified to be functional and persistent.
