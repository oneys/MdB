The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing and modernizing a SaaS real estate platform MVP. Initial efforts tackled critical frontend white screen errors, which stemmed from  context issues in JavaScript and incorrect data fetching (using mock data instead of API calls). Persistence bugs, particularly with drag & drop functionality and general project modifications, required backend Pydantic enum updates and refined API calls. A significant phase involved a complete UI/UX overhaul to a Base SaaS Dashboard UI Kit style, replacing all legacy interfaces with new modern components. This necessitated fixing numerous frontend integration issues related to , component rendering, and data display. Towards the end, the AI implemented core features like project creation, detailed editing, deletion (with double confirmation), Google Maps integration, and a cost distribution pie chart. The work concluded with these features being integrated and the AI awaiting user validation for their functionality, specifically mentioning project creation and the pie chart as needing full testing.

The goal is a SaaS platform for real estate dealers (marchands de biens) to make quick Go/No Go decisions, track projects, automate financial calculations (TVA sur marge, acquisition costs, net margin, IRR), and generate official documents. The platform requires a dashboard with KPIs, a Kanban pipeline, a fiscal estimator with tax regimes and notary fees, project sheets, a dataroom, and PDF export. Authentication must support Email/OAuth2 with role management. The UI/UX should be modern, initially using Shadcn/UI, later evolving to a Base SaaS Dashboard UI Kit design. The development followed a phased approach, prioritizing stabilization. Key user requests included fixing a white screen error, resolving drag & drop persistence, ensuring dynamic calculations, addressing document upload/download issues, enabling project status editing from detail pages, and integrating Google Maps for project creation/modification, and a cost distribution pie chart.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the integration and refinement of several critical features. The entire application UI has been transitioned to a Base SaaS Dashboard UI Kit style, with all older components removed. The latest work involved:
1.  **Project Creation**: The  was modified to ensure correct API calls and validation, addressing previous user reports of creation failures.
2.  **Google Maps**: Integrated Google Maps into both the  for creation and  for modification, allowing users to link project addresses to maps.
3.  **Cost Distribution Pie Chart**: Code was added to  to render a pie chart visualizing project cost distribution, preparing for its visual validation.

The application is now accessible via an external URL. Key features like a functional Kanban pipeline with persistent drag & drop, a fiscal estimator with backend calculations, and comprehensive project CRUD (create, read, modify, delete with double-confirmation) are in place. The dashboard displays metrics and graphs, and the backend handles project data (including 8 demo projects). Authentication via a temporary development session is active.
